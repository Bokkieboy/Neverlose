## ⚠️ Important Information

### Neverlose recently tweaked there API, therefore the menu still works, but slight lean angles and AA will need to be changed. I will no longer be updating this script due to neverlose slowly leaving the market, I may work on new and fun skeet LUA's but for the time being I'm experimenting with new languages.
